Title: Website up to the Cloud using CloudControl
----
Text:

The following steps require that you create an account on CloudControl. To do so, visit the website of CloudControl at [http://cloudcontrol.com](//cloudcontrol.com). Once you have created the account, you need to activate it. CloudControl will send an activation link via mail to the mail address you gave them when creating your account. Click on the activation link once you have received the mail.

## What you'll learn
In this unit you will

- Add a public CloudControl key
- create an app on CloudControl
- push your repo to CloudControl
- deploy your repo on CloudControl

## Step-by-Step
1. Open Terminal (link on desktop of VM).
4. Go to the folder **public_html/your_html5MobileBoilerplate_folder** (where your_html5MobileBoilerplate_folder" is a placeholder for the folder in which you have created your project; if all your files are in root (i.e. public_html), then use this folder.
5. To add your public CloudControl key, enter the following command:
		
		cctrluser key.add
		Email   : EMAIL
		Password: PASSWORD
 
  Type in your CloudControl username and password.	 A new key will be generated and uploaded to CloudControl.
  **Note**: You only need to create this key once. When you create new apps in the future (e.g. for other assignments) you don't need to repeat this step.
 
1. Visit [CloudControl](http://cloudcontrol.com) and login to your account.
2. To create a new app
	- go to the menu item **Console**
	- click the **New App** button
	- enter a name for your app, e.g. "myfirsttestapp" and choose **PHP**  as type of application
	- click the **New App** button to create the app

 **Note**: You can also create a new app using the command line by typing the following command:
 		
 		$ cctrlapp APP_NAME create php 
 		
 Note: APP_Name is a placeholder for an app name of your choice, you may only use small letters and no special characters.
 	
   
5.   Push your repo to CloudControl

		cctrlapp APP_NAME push             // replace APP_Name with the name of the app you created in step 5.
		
 Your repo is uploaded to CloudControl.	 The following messages are displayed in Terminal once you have pushed your app:
 
 		Counting objects: 63, done.
		Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
		Compressing objects: 100% (59/59), done.
		Writing objects: 100% (63/63), 100.11 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
		Total 63 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)

		-----> Building image
		-----> Uploading image (96K)
		       
		To ssh://html5mobileboilerplate@cloudcontrolled.com/repository.git
		 * [new branch]      master -> master
 
6. Now you have to deploy the files so that you can view them on CloudControl:

		cctrlapp APP_Name deploy	

7. To view the results, visit your app by typing the URL of your app into the address field of your browser:

		http://APP_NAME.cloudcontrolled.com
