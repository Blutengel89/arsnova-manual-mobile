4. In the next window, enter a name, e.g. **html5MobileBoilerplate**, as name for the new project. Choose the folder you created in the first tutorial /**home/developer/public_html/your_html5MobileBoilerplate_folder** (replace "your_html5MobileBoilerplate_folder with the name of your folder) as location for the project (if necessary, uncheck "Use default location" first).

8. Now edit the contents of the  **index.html** where it says "Add your site or application content here", i.e. add the video tag for the homework and any other content of your choice.
9. Save the file.
9. Open your browser and type **http://localhost/your_html5MobileBoilerplate_folder** into the address field. You should now see the contents of the newly saved index.html.

**Notes:**

- If you get an error message when trying to open **http://localhost/your_html5MobileBoilerplate_folder**, make sure that your **index.html** is in that folder.
