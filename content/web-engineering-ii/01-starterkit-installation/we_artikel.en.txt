----
Text:

1. [Download the correct version of VirtualBox for your operating system](//www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install (process varies depending on your OS).
2. Start VirtualBox.
3. Download and install a BitTorrent Client, see [list](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BitTorrent_clients).
4. [Download course VM](//ecollab.eu/DeveloperVM.ova.torrent?__hstc=162494947.ba565441a99e7afa0c72a990633dff84.1382358162835.1384017291658.1384021188975.115&__hssc=162494947.22.1384021188975&__hsfp=3693253106). System requirements:
    - Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon (min. 1,5 GHz), preferably multi-core processor
    - 2 GB memory
    -  8 GB free disk space
    - internet connection;)
5. To import the course VM (DeveloperVM.ova) into VirtualBox, double-click on the file. In VirtualBox Manager, an Import Window opens. Make sure that "Reinitialize the MAC addresses of all network cards" ("Zuweisen neuer MAC Adressen für alle Netzwerkkarten) is checked. Click on "Import" to import the virtual machine.

6. Start the VM: Select it and click "Start". The VM starts just like a normal PC with a lot of boot messages.
7. Login to the VM:
	- Login name: developer
	- Password: developer
	
8. You are greeted by the desktop of the VM. To change the language of the VM from German to English, refer to the instructions below.

	On the desktop of the VM you will find all the tools needed for the course:
   		
   	 - Firefox Browser and Chromium Browser with links to Webserver and ARSnova
	 - Eclipse IDE
	 - Link to keyboard settings (Tastatur), in case you need to choose another keyboard layout
	 - Link to personal folder (Persönliches Verzeichnis) that contains a link to the folder public_html (which serves as root folder for the Apache Webserver, i.e. /home/developer/public_html). The public_html folder is the one into which the  html5-mobile-boilerplate folder needs to be unzipped in step 10.
 	 - Link to Terminal (at the bottom of Desktop)
9. In the VM, open Firefox or Chromium to go to [http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/]( http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/) and click on "Download". 
10. Unzip the folder into public_html. You should now have a folder called "h5bp-mobile-boilerplate-eb25172" in public_html. If you want, rename that folder to something more memorable, e.g. MyFirstApp or HTML5App or whatever. Now you are ready to [set up your first HTML5 Mobile Boilerplate project in the next step](create-first-bootstrap-project).

	  The image shows the public_html folder with the "h5bp-mobile-boilerplate-eb25172" folder renamed to "html5MobileBoilerplate".
